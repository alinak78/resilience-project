## Climate Adaptation Solutions - Topic Modeling and N-Grams Analysis

This project analyzes text descriptions of climate adaptation solutions to identify common topics and key phrases. Using Python libraries like **NLTK**, **Sklearn**, **Gensim**, and **PyLDAvis**, it performs text preprocessing, generates bigrams, and applies topic modeling with **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**. The results are visualized interactively, allowing users to explore topics and related terms.

### Key Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes text descriptions.
- **Bigram Generation**: Extracts frequent two-word phrases for insights into common themes.
- **Topic Modeling with LDA**: Generates topics using Sklearn and Gensim LDA models.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Saves an HTML visualization for exploring topics and keywords.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation with code explanations for easy reference.
